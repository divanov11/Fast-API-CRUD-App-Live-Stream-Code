# Dennis Ivy FastAPI CRUD App
This is a simple app designed to play around with FastAPI with a basic CRUD app.
The article accompanying the app can be found at https://medium.com/@dennisivy/my-first-crud-app-with-fast-api-74ac190d2dcc and the livestreamed video can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOZNYBu8u18.

## Installation
In order to run the app, it is recommended you first create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
# python3 -m venv env if on an older system where python 2.7
# is the default version used when calling "python"

# Activate Virtual Environment
# Windows
env\Scripts\activate

# Unix-based
source env/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run the app
There are multiple options available when running the app.
The way you're likely going to want to do it is by running the command
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

If you would like to choose a specific port (if 8000 is already occupied by another program), then you can run
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port <PORT>
```
where the `<PORT>` is a number of your choosing.
For the rest of the options when running a uvicorn app, visit https://www.uvicorn.org/#command-line-options.

In case you would like to use built-in Swagger UI, then you can add `/docs#` at the end of the URL.
